# My dotfiles
Dotfiles are like **your** thing. Everyone loves their own dotfiles.       
This repo will contain all of my dotfiles. Expected to grow slowly.      
May or may not work for you.      
Inspired from [holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). But I didn't need those many files and also I am too lazy to organise my files that beautifully. Till that day comes, this is what I have.
